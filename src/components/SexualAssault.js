      <h1>Sexual Assault</h1>
      <p>
        Sexual assault is any type of sexual activity or contact, including
        rape, that happens without your consent. Sexual assault can include
        non-contact activities, such as someone “flashing” you (exposing
        themselves to you) or forcing you to look at sexual images.2 Sexual
        assault is also called sexual violence or abuse. Legal definitions of
        sexual assault and other crimes of sexual violence can vary slightly
        from state to state. If you’ve been assaulted, it is never your fault.
      </p>
      <h2>Sexual assault include:</h2>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            Any type of sexual contact with someone who cannot consent, such as
            someone who is underage (as defined by state laws), has an
            intellectual disability, or is passed out (such as from drugs or
            alcohol) or unable to respond (such as from sleeping)
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Any type of sexual contact with someone who does not consent</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Rape</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Attempted rape</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Sexual coercion</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Fondling or unwanted touching above or under clothes</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Sexual harassment or threats</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Forcing someone to pose for sexual pictures</p>
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>What does consent mean</h2>
      <p>
        Consent is a clear “yes” to sexual activity. Not saying “no” does not
        mean you have given consent. Sexual contact without consent is sexual
        assault or rape.
      </p>
      <p>Your consent means: </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            You know and understand what is going on (you are not unconscious,
            blacked out, asleep, underage, or have an intellectual disability).
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            You are aware that you are giving consent (and are not impaired by
            alcohol or drugs).
          </p>
        </li>
        <p>Remember :</p>
        <li>
          <p>
            <strong>Consent is an ongoing process,</strong> not a one-time
            question. If you consent to sexual activity, you can change your
            mind and choose to stop at any time, even after sexual activity has
            started.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <strong>Past consent does not mean future consent.</strong> Giving
            consent in the past to sexual activity does not mean your past
            consent applies now or in the future.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <strong>
              Saying “yes” to a sexual activity is not consent for all types of
              sexual activity.
            </strong>{" "}
            If you consent to sexual activity, it is only for types of sexual
            activities that you are comfortable with at that time with that
            partner. For example, giving consent for kissing does not mean you
            are giving consent for someone to remove your clothes.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>What to do if you've been sexually assaulted</h2>
      <p>
        If you are in danger or need medical care, visit the nearest police
        station or hospital or alternatively you can call the Musasa project
        Hotline. If you can, get away from the person who assaulted you and get
        to a safe place as fast as you can.
      </p>
      <h2>What to do if you've been rapped</h2>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            <strong>Get to a safe place. </strong> The most important thing
            after a rape is your safety.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <strong>Don't wash or clean your body </strong> If you shower,
            bathe, or wash after an assault, you might wash away important
            evidence. Don’t brush, comb, or clean any part of your body,
            including your teeth. Don’t change clothes, if possible. Don’t touch
            or change anything at the scene of the assault. That way, the local
            police will have physical evidence from the person who assaulted
            you.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <strong>Get medical care. </strong>Go to your nearest hospital
            emergency room. You need to be examined and treated for injuries.
            The doctor or nurse may give you medicine to prevent HIV and some
            other sexually transmitted infections (STIs) and emergency
            contraception to prevent pregnancy.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <strong>Report the sexual assault to the police.</strong>If you want
            to report the assault to the police, hospital workers can help you
            contact the local police
          </p>
