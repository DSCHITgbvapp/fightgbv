      <h1>Stalking</h1>
      <p>
        Stalking is repeated contact that makes you feel afraid or harassed.
        Someone may stalk you by following you or calling you often. Stalkers
        may also use technology to stalk you by sending unwanted emails or
        social media messages. About one in six women has experienced stalking
        in her lifetime. Women are twice as likely to be stalked as men are.
        Stalking is a crime.
      </p>
      <p>
        Stalking may also be a sign of an abusive relationship. Someone who is
        stalking you may threaten your safety by clearly saying they want to
        harm you. Some stalkers harass you with less threatening but still
        unwanted contact. The use of technology to stalk, sometimes called
        “cyberstalking,” involves using the Internet, email, or other electronic
        communications to stalk someone. Stalking is against the law. Stalking
        and cyberstalking can lead to sleeping problems or problems at work or
        school.

      <h2>What to do if you're being stalked</h2>
      <p>
        Find a safe place to go if you are being followed or worry that you will
        be followed. Go to a police station, friend’s house, domestic violence
        shelter, fire station, or public area.
      </p>
      <p>You can also take the following steps if you are being stalked:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            File a complaint with the police. Make sure to tell them about all
            threats and incidents.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Get a restraining order. A restraining order requires the stalker to
            stay away from you and not contact you. (from Police)
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Write down every incident. Include the time, date, and other
            important information. If the incidents occurred online, take
            screenshots as records.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Keep evidence such as videotapes, voicemail messages, photos of
            property damage, and letters.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Get help from domestic violence hotlines e.h Musasa project</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Consider changing your phone number (although some people leave
            their number active so they can collect evidence). You can also ask
            your service provider about call blocking and other safety features.
