      <h1>Sexual coercion</h1>
      <p>
        Sexual coercion is unwanted sexual activity that happens when you are
        pressured, tricked, threatened, or forced in a nonphysical way. Coercion
        can make you think you owe sex to someone. It might be from someone who
        has power over you, like a teacher, landlord, or a boss. No person is
        ever required to have sex with someone else.
      </p>

      <h2>Difference between coercion and consent</h2>
      <p>
        If you don't really want to have sex but agree because you feel
        obligated or don't want the other person to get mad, you aren't
        consenting voluntarily. Coercion happens when someone wants you to
        consent when you've already said no or otherwise expressed disinterest.
      </p>
      <h1>Examples of sexual coercion</h1>
      <p>

      <p>
        <em>Making you feel like it’s too late to say no</em>

      <p>

      <h2>How can I respond in the moment to sexual coercion?</h2>
      <p>
        Sexual coercion is not your fault. If you are feeling pressured to do
        something you don’t want to do, speak up or leave the situation. It is
        better to risk a relationship ending or hurting someone’s feelings than
        to do something you aren’t willing to do.
      </p>
      <p>
        If the person trying to coerce you is in a position of power over you
        (such as a boss, landlord, or teacher), it’s best to leave the situation
        as quickly and safely as possible. It might be difficult, but if you can
        report the person to someone in authority, you are taking steps to stop
        it from happening again. Some possible verbal responses include:{" "}
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          “If you really care for me, you’ll respect that I don’t want to have
          sex."
        </li>
        <li>“I don’t owe you an explanation or anything at all.”</li>
        <li>“You must be mistaken. I don’t want to have sex with you."</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Be clear and direct with the person trying to coerce you. Tell the
        person how you feel and what you do not want to do. If the person is not
        listening to you, leave the situation. If you or your family is in
        physical danger, try to get away from the person as quickly as possible.
