# Description 

Confidant is a Web based platform developed to fight GBV. The platform was developed after noticing an increase in the number of gender based violence cases in the country due to the imposed lockdown as those people who were in abusive relationships are now spending more time with their abusers.

It allows users to

1. Report GBV cases
2. Find details of where they can get GBV related help.
3. Read GBV victimsâ€™ stories or share their own GBV stories
4. Learn about GBV and other types of violence.
5. Look at the Zimbabwean and worldwide GBV statistics.
6. Go through an assessment that will determine if they are at risk of GBV.

- Removed the chat feature advice from someone who works for an NGO that focuses on GBV, saying why would someone use our chat feature instead of going straight to Musasa's whatsapp number
